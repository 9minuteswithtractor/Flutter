## app-about: ❓

    This app is my first introduction to app-testing with Flutter. 
    I believe that app-testing is very important aspect of app-development
    and I will revisit this topic later in my Flutter journey. As it is for now, 
    I have participated in Googles offered codelab 'flutter-app-testing' and have 
    some general overview about each of the testing 
    methods ( Unit test, Widget test, Integration test).
